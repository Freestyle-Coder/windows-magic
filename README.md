A Simple c++ command line application to manipulate other processes.
Functionality:
  Rename Windows
  List Controls
  Enable controls (doesnt work on .NET)
Maybe i will extend the programs functionality some day if im bored.
And i will probably make a GUI version.

Why it doesnt work in .NET:
  to bo honest i don't really know.
  But i have a theory.
  I think that if you make a disabled button in .NET the control is not only grayed out 
  but is also unable to use the event that triggers when you press the button.
  Im fucking unable to phrase proper english sentences but i hope you get what i mean^^.
